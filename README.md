This is a minimum implementation of flickr search api.
usage: just type tag.

Created service, component and then model and view layer.
Also incorporated the feature of search suggestion using hardcoded tag values.
I intended to use flickrs "hotTag" Api so that I can get the tags that are popular and suggest as type ahead in search box.
I tried to finish the solution in 2~3 hours.

Improvements:
If I keep working on this project I would spend some time on pagination, carousel on the flickr image part.
Improve binding and autocomplete search part.
I would use navigation so that  better view  module is linked to the previous page.
I would design a nicer bootstrap template for single page application.
I would implement some error handling.
